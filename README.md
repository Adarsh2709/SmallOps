## 1. The Problem

AI models can write working code from a prompt in seconds: a form, a tracker, a dashboard, or a lightweight internal tool. However, turning generated code into software that a team can reliably use still requires:

- Cloud provisioning and DevOps knowledge to deploy and expose live URLs
- Setting up authentication, user pools, and login flows
- Provisioning databases or object storage for application state
- Distributing access securely without sending raw source archives
- Safe maintenance and bug repair that will not silently break previously working features

Traditional cloud platforms are built for large-scale enterprise systems, introducing significant setup complexity. Most AI-generated applications are small software: single-purpose tools built for an individual or small team that must be deployed, shared, and maintained with zero friction.

TBD provides a dedicated, opinionated cloud platform designed specifically for small software, running natively on AWS.

## 2. Core Architecture and Capabilities

1. **Clarify-Then-Build**: Checks the prompt for structural ambiguities before generating code, asking up to 3 focused questions with default recommendations.
2. **Instant Deployment**: Deploys isolated container or serverless workloads to live, HTTPS-enabled AWS URLs in seconds.
3. **Zero-Config Auth and Sharing**: Wraps every deployed app in role-based authentication (Viewer and Editor) via magic links and OTP, without modifying the generated application logic.
4. **Decision Timeline and Deterministic Revert**: Records every plan, tool invocation, code diff, and deployment state in an interactive tree graph, enabling one-click rollback to any historical snapshot.
5. **Autonomous Maintenance**: Detects application errors and health degradation, diagnoses root causes with Amazon Bedrock, verifies candidate repairs locally in isolation, and enforces safety guards before any code is promoted.

---

## 3. Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 3.1 Prompt-to-App Generation
- Accepts natural language descriptions through a clean chat interface.
- Deconstructs requirements into a structured specification and generates complete, runnable Python/FastAPI or static frontend applications.
- Powered by Amazon Bedrock foundation models with strict schema validation.

### 3.2 Clarify-Then-Build
- Before generating code, an ambiguity detection step evaluates whether the prompt has missing data schemas, unclear role distinctions, or conflicting requirements.
- If ambiguities exist, the system prompts the user with up to 3 targeted multiple-choice questions with preselected defaults.
- Once answered or confirmed, code generation executes deterministically without conversational loops.
- Clarification questions and user choices are recorded as the root node of the Decision Timeline.

### 3.3 Instant AWS Deployment
- Applications are deployed to live, isolated AWS endpoints within 10 to 20 seconds.
- Execution options include:
  - **Fast-path runtime**: AWS Lambda functions paired with Function URLs for lightweight single-file applications.
  - **Container runtime**: AWS Fargate (ECS) tasks behind an Application Load Balancer for multi-file or stateful applications.
- Zero manual cloud configuration or infrastructure provisioning required by the end user.

### 3.4 Zero-Config Sharing and Role-Based Auth
- Every deployed app is secured out of the box using Amazon Cognito.
- Application owners can invite team members via email using Amazon SES.
- Collaborators authenticate via passwordless magic links or OTP tokens.
- Role enforcement:
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to the running application.
  - **Editor**: Ability to submit modification prompts, inspect the decision timeline, trigger reverts, and request maintenance.

### 3.5 Decision Timeline and One-Click Revert
- Every agent action (clarification, planning, code generation, linting, deployment, maintenance) is logged as an immutable node in Amazon DynamoDB.
- Visualized as a connected graph where successful paths form the main trunk, while retries and maintenance repairs branch off cleanly.
- Node inspection panel provides:
  - Input prompt and system context
  - LLM reasoning and execution plan
  - Unified code diffs
  - Execution latency and token usage metrics
  - Node status (SUCCESS, ERROR, REVERTED)
- **Deterministic Revert**: Instantly rolls back the live AWS deployment to the exact code snapshot stored at any previous node without re-prompting.

### 3.6 Continuous Live Editing
- Users can request incremental changes in natural language ("add CSV export", "filter by date range").
- The agent computes localized diffs against the latest code snapshot and redeploys to the same stable URL.
- Each modification creates a new timeline node, maintaining a complete audit trail.

### 3.7 Autonomous Maintenance and Self-Healing
- **Health Probing**: Async synthetic HTTP health monitor tests endpoints for status codes, latency spikes, and connection failures.
- **Root-Cause Diagnosis and Repair**: Ingests error logs, stack traces, and existing code snapshots to produce targeted code patches via Amazon Bedrock.
- **Candidate Verification**: Compiles candidate code in an isolated environment, verifies syntax, imports the handler, and runs smoke executions to guarantee functional validity before deployment.
- **Safety Guards**:
  - Max 2 repair attempts per maintenance job to prevent looping.
  - Concurrency lock per application to prevent overlapping maintenance runs.
  - Prompt sanitization to strip injection payloads from untrusted stack traces.
  - Configuration guardrails rejecting unauthorized modifications to authentication, environment settings, or infrastructure.

## 7. Operational Workflow

### 7.1 Creation and Deployment
1. **Prompt Intake**: The user submits a natural language app request.
2. **Ambiguity Clarification**: The agent identifies underspecified requirements and requests targeted choices with recommended defaults.
3. **Plan and Codegen**: The agent creates an execution plan, generates structured application code, and validates imports.
4. **Deploy**: The code is packaged and deployed to an isolated AWS Lambda or Fargate endpoint.
5. **Timeline Logging**: All steps, rationale, and the initial code snapshot are committed to DynamoDB.

### 7.2 Sharing and Collaboration
1. **Invite**: The app owner invites collaborators by email.
2. **Session**: Collaborators receive an SES-dispatched link and authenticate via Cognito OTP.
3. **Role Enforcement**: Viewers access the application UI; Editors can submit modification requests and manage rollbacks.

### 7.3 Iterative Editing and Reversion
1. **Chat Updates**: The owner requests updates; the agent generates a patch and redeploys to the same URL.
2. **Audit and Rollback**: If a change causes unexpected behavior, the user opens the timeline, selects a prior verified node, and triggers a deterministic rollback.

### 7.4 Auto-Maintenance Pipeline

## 8. Architectural & Engineering Decisions

Building an autonomous platform that generates, tests, and deploys arbitrary code safely requires specific architectural trade-offs.

### 8.1 Serverless (AWS Lambda) vs. Containers (Docker/Fargate)
For executing the generated end-user applications, we strictly utilize **AWS Lambda** over long-running Docker containers (like ECS/Fargate) for several reasons:
- **Instantaneous Spin-Up**: LLM-generated apps need to be live in seconds. Updating a Lambda function's inline code takes ~1-3 seconds. Conversely, building a Docker image, pushing to ECR, and waiting for Fargate to provision an ENI and pull the image takes 2-5 minutes.
- **Scale-to-Zero Economics**: The platform hosts thousands of experimental "small software" apps. Lambda scales to zero instantly, ensuring idle user apps cost exactly $0.00.
- **MicroVM Isolation**: Running untrusted, AI-generated code is dangerous. AWS Lambda uses the Firecracker microVM, providing strict, hardware-level isolation for every generated app without the overhead of managing Kubernetes or Docker sandboxes.
- **Stateless Constraints**: By forcing generated apps to run in a stateless Lambda environment, the LLM is guided to properly utilize the attached DynamoDB persistence layer rather than relying on ephemeral local file systems.

### 8.2 DynamoDB vs. Relational SQL
- **Sub-10ms Latency**: Multi-tenant AI platforms require rapid state retrieval for decision timelines. DynamoDB provides predictable, single-digit millisecond latency.
- **Flexible Schema**: Generated applications often have unpredictable data models. A NoSQL Key-Value store allows the LLM to store diverse JSON payloads without needing to explicitly generate and run rigid SQL schema migrations.

### 8.3 Dual-LLM Pipeline (Bedrock + Gemini)
- **Rate-Limit Resilience**: AWS Bedrock (Claude/DeepSeek) provides strict, enterprise-grade generation but is subject to IAM account quotas. By injecting a seamless fallback to Google Gemini, the platform guarantees 99.9% uptime for the code generation pipeline even under heavy concurrent load.

---

## 9. Safety and Reliability Controls

- **Per-Job Attempt Budget**: Strictly enforces a maximum of 2 repair attempts per maintenance job to eliminate infinite loops.
- **Concurrency Locks**: Prevents overlapping maintenance jobs from executing against the same application.
- **Input Sanitization**: Cleans untrusted stack traces, error outputs, and issue descriptions before embedding them in LLM prompts to prevent prompt injection.
- **Configuration Protection**: Rejects patches attempting to modify system-level configurations, authentication mechanisms, or cloud infrastructure.
- **Pre-Deployment Isolation**: All candidate code must pass AST compilation, handler extraction, and isolated execution tests before deployment is initiated.

---

## 10. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ (3.12 is required for `moto` AWS mocking to work flawlessly in tests)
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- AWS Account (for Cognito, DynamoDB, S3)
- Google Gemini API Key (Optional, but highly recommended as fallback)

### 10.1 Configuration (`.env`)
Create a `.env` file in the **root** of the project (`BharatBuilds/.env`) and add the following keys. 

```env
# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

# Amazon Bedrock (Primary LLM - Optional if using Gemini)
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=deepseek.v3-1

# Google Gemini API (Fallback LLM)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL_ID=gemini-2.5-flash

# DynamoDB
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=bharatbuilds-table

# Cognito
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# S3 & Deployment
S3_ASSETS_BUCKET=bharatbuilds-assets
DEPLOY_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=bharatbuilds-deploy-runner
```

*Note: The backend features an intelligent **Dual-LLM** pipeline. It attempts AWS Bedrock first if `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` is set and credentials are valid. If rate limits, permission boundaries, or invalid keys cause a failure, it seamlessly falls back to the Google Gemini API.*

### 10.2 Backend Setup
From the project root:

```bash
python -m venv backend/.venv
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Run backend test suite (fully covered with mocked AWS services)
export PYTHONPATH=.
pytest backend/

# Start local API server
export PYTHONPATH=.
uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8000
```
The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 10.3 Frontend Setup
In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Set Vite environment variables inside frontend/.env
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
echo "VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id" >> .env
echo "VITE_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id" >> .env

# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 11. Intelligent Deployments & Fallbacks

- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: End-users have the freedom to bypass platform rate limits by using their own AWS Bedrock account. By clicking the "⚙️ BYOK" Settings toggle in the frontend Navbar, users can input their `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`. The backend dynamically provisions isolated Bedrock clients on a per-request basis for these users, securely falling back to platform defaults if their keys fail.
- **AWS IAM Graceful Bypass**: If your AWS IAM User does not have `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` permissions (or if deployment fails for any reason), the backend gracefully bypasses AWS Lambda and serves your generated applications directly via the `/apps/{app_id}/live` FastAPI route.
- **Dual-LLM Routing**: Enjoy the reliability of Bedrock with the flexibility of Gemini. Ensure at least one set of keys is provided.

---

## 12. Testing and CI/CD

A fully automated **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** is integrated into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. On every push to `main`:
1. It provisions **Python 3.12** and runs all `125` robust backend Pytest suites (with auto-mocked AWS environments).
2. It provisions **Node 20**, installs UI dependencies, and executes `npm run build` to type-check `tsc` and Vite-compile the React frontend.

To run tests locally:
```bash
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=.
pytest backend/
```
